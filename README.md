# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images.  
The model is trained using **Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2** and deployed using a **Flask web application** where users can upload a leaf image and get a predicted disease.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Plant diseases can significantly affect crop production and agricultural productivity. Early detection helps farmers take preventive actions and improve crop yield.

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on the **PlantVillage dataset** to identify plant diseases from leaf images.

Users can upload a leaf image through the web interface and the system predicts the disease.

# 🌱 Dataset

The model was trained using the **PlantVillage dataset** available on Kaggle.

Dataset link:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset

The dataset contains:

- 70,000+ leaf images
- 38 plant disease categories
- Images of healthy and diseased leaves

Because the dataset is large, it is **not included in this repository**.

To download the dataset:


Go to the Kaggle dataset link above

Download the dataset

Extract it into the project folder as:
